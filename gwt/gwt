SUPER DEV MODE http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html
1. How it works

At startup, Dev Mode overwrites the GWT application’s nocache.js files with stub files that automatically recompile 
the GWT application if necessary.
The GWT application itself is loaded from a separate web server running on a different port (9876 by default).

2. Debug
we can’t use a normal Java debugger like in classic Dev Mode
Browser debuggers are designed for debugging JavaScript. However, the SourceMaps standard allows the debugger 
to display source code for Java (and other languages) instead of JavaScript files.
In Chrome, you might need to turn on Source Maps in the debugger.
